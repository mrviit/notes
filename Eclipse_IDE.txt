/// What are run configurations?
A run configuration defines the environment which will be used to execute a generic launch.
For example, it defines arguments to the Java virtual machine (VM), plug-in (classpath) dependencies, etc.

To pass system properties to your Eclipse application, you can add launch parameters using the -D switch. 
As example, if you add the argument -Dmy.product.loglevel=INFO, 
you can get the "INFO" value with System.getProperties("my.product.loglevel").

If you are developing Eclipse RCP applications, the launch configuration is created based on the product configuration file.
