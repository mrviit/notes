git rev-list --all | (
    while read revision; do
        git grep -F 'SWT.F2' $revision
    done
)

///

git log foo.rb | grep "bar"

///

git grep <regexp> $(git rev-list --all)

///

To find which commits and which files a string was added or removed in:

git log -S'search string' --oneline --name-status

To see the diff of that

git log -S'search string' -p | grep 'search string' -C5

You can also do a regex search by using -G instead of -S.

git branch -m <newname>		// rename the current branch
git branch -m <oldname> <newname>		//rename a branch while pointed to any branch
