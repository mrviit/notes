JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:
Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.
Writing into the HTML output using document.write().
Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().
Writing into the browser console, using console.log().

Comparing two JavaScript objects will always return false.

There are 3 JavaScript methods that can be used to convert variables to numbers:
The Number() method: If the number cannot be converted, NaN (Not a Number) is returned. can also convert a date to a number
The parseInt() method: parses a string and returns a whole number. Spaces are allowed. Only the first number is returned
The parseFloat() method
These methods are not number methods, but global JavaScript methods.

Number(new Date("2017-09-30")); // returns the number of milliseconds since 1.1.1970
var x = Number.MAX_VALUE;	// MIN_VALUE, NEGATIVE_INFINITY, NaN, POSITIVE_INFINITY

Number properties belongs to the JavaScript's number object wrapper called Number
=> Number Properties Cannot be Used on Variables
var x = 6;
var y = x.MAX_VALUE; // y becomes undefined

Arrays with named indexes are called associative arrays (or hashes).
JavaScript does not support arrays with named indexes.
In JavaScript, arrays always use numbered indexes. 
If you use named indexes, JavaScript will redefine the array to a standard object.
After that, some array methods and properties will produce incorrect results.
var person = [];
person["firstName"] = "John";
person["lastName"] = "Doe";
person["age"] = 46;
var x = person.length;         // person.length will return 0
var y = person[0];             // person[0] will return undefined

Arrays use numbered indexes. Objects use named indexes. Arrays are a special kind of objects, with numbered indexes.

// How to Recognize an Array
Array.isArray(fruits);	// ECMAScript 5

function isArray(x) {
    return x.constructor.toString().indexOf("Array") > -1;
	// x.constructor === Array;
}

fruits instanceof Array;

Arrays methods: push, pop, shift, unshift, splice, slice

delete fruits[0];           // Changes the first element in fruits to undefined


In JavaScript, the first day of the week (0) means "Sunday", even if some countries in the world consider the first day of the week to be "Monday"
JavaScript counts months from 0 to 11. January is 0. December is 11.


Unlike other global objects, the Math object has no constructor. Methods and properties are static.

The constructor property returns the constructor function for all JavaScript variables.

/// debugger keyword

/// Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope (to the top of the current script or the current function).

/// "use strict";

///
Object.defineProperty(obj, "x", {value:0, writable:false});

/// get-only property
var obj = {get x() {return 0} }; // obj.x

/// var let const

/// The bind(), call() and apply() methods are predefined JavaScript methods.
var printHocsinhName = Hocsinh.printName.bind(Hocsinh);
printHocsinhName(); 

var printHocsinhName = Hocsinh.printName;
printHocsinhName.call(Hocsinh);

Hocsinh.printName.call(window);  

/// Avoid global variables,  avoid new,  avoid  ==,  avoid eval()
The eval() function is used to run text as code.

/// Nested Functions / inner function -> Closures
// Closure là một function đi kèm với envirment của nó
A closure is a function having access to the parent scope, even after the parent function has closed.
var add = (function () {
    var counter = 0;
    return function () {counter += 1; return counter}
})();
add();

/// Never break a return statement.

///
var myObject = {10: 'test1'}
myObject.10;             //Throw Error
myObject['10'];          //test1

///execution context: global execution context > Function execution context
When the program calls a function. A few steps:
1) JavaScript creates a new execution context, a local execution context
2) That local execution context will have its own set of variables, these variables will be local to that execution context.
3) The new execution context is thrown onto the execution (call) stack. Think of the execution stack as a mechanism to keep track of where the program is in its execution

When a function ends, the following happens:
1) The local execution contexts pops off the execution stack
2) The functions sends the return value back to the calling context. The calling context is the execution context that called this function, it could be the global execution context or another local execution context. It is up to the calling execution context to deal with the return value at that point. The returned value could be an object, an array, a function, a boolean, anything really. If the function has no return statement, undefined is returned.
3) The local execution context is destroyed. All the variables that were declared within the local execution context are erased. 

When a function gets declared, it contains a function definition and a closure.
==>> The closure (scope) is a collection of all the variables in scope at the time of creation of the function.
A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared.
For every closure we have three scopes: Local Scope ( Own scope), Outer Functions Scope, Global Scope
